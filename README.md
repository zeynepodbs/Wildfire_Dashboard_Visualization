# Wildfire_Dashboard_Visualization

This project was completed as part of a **Coursera / IBM Developer Skills Network** practice lab.  
It demonstrates how to build an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize wildfire activity across regions.  
All implementation and visualization design were done by me.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic dashboard that:
- Visualizes wildfire occurrences and intensity over time  
- Allows filtering by region, cause, or date range  
- Uses Plotly and Dash to generate interactive visual analytics

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Plotly Dash** (interactive dashboard)
- **Plotly Express / Graph Objects** (visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python Script**
